My implementation of standard smart contracts and smart contract building blocks.

## Contracts

```ml
tokens
├─ ERC721 - "Minimal version of ERC-721"
├─ ERC20 — "An implementation of ERC-20 + EIP-2612
```
## Safety

These contracts are purely done as a **learning exercise** for myself and are not audited. Any usage of these contracts in your own code should be done with **extreme caution**.

I am not liable for any damages or loss that may occur from using this code.
